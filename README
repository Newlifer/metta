To build Metta execute the following commands:

 $ cd src
 $ ./waf

You will need gcc 4.4.2 or above and yasm to build.

After successful build run emulator software to try out Metta.
src directory is preconfigured for using Bochs, so you can simply type:

 $ bochs -q

== Following is for developers only! ==

For experimental building with clang first copy waftools/clang.py to
.waf-..../wafadmin/Tools, then configure to use it:
 
 $ ./waf configure --check-c-compiler=clang --check-cxx-compiler=clang

Then you can try to build:

 $ ./waf
