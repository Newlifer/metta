Metta is a multimedia, mobile, social OS.
-----------------------------------------

My goal is to make Metta the platform for social, efficient and fun life on the internet. I call such internet egocentric, because it revolves around your needs and desires.

Be free!

== To build Metta ==

0. Check out the sources following the procedure on the http://metta.exquance.com/wiki/SourceCheckout:

 $ mkdir Metta/branches
 $ cd Metta/branches
 $ bzr init-repo .
 $ bzr branch http://metta.exquance.com/bzr master

Sources will be checked out into branch "master" under "Metta/branches". The reason for having this deep directory structure is toolchain builder will create toolchain directory under Metta, shared by all branches. init-repo in branches also helps reduce overhead of branching in this directory.

1. Install yasm assembler, 'brew install yasm' for example.

2. Generate a toolchain.

 $ cd Metta
 $ sh branches/master/build_toolchain.sh

This is going to take a while.

If you're unable to build toolchain locally and are on a Lion Mac, download prebuilt one and unpack it.

 $ cd Metta
 $ wget http://downloads.exquance.com/toolchain-x86_64-darwin.tar.bz2
 $ tar xf toolchain-x86_64-darwin.tar.bz2

3. Build Metta

 $ cd Metta/branches/master/src
 $ ./waf

4. After successful build run emulator software to try out Metta.

src directory is preconfigured for using Bochs, so you can simply type:

 $ bochs -q
