Single address space system - pointers can be passed freely between domains without any translation. Memory protection
implemented via MMU. Support only single synchronization primitive - the event. All other primitives are built upon
this type by the userspace libraries. Minimal privileged-mode core. Only the IRQ handlers and privileged MMU 
instructions are in this core.

Loader:
- load nucleus.
- install IDT and setup syscalls. (what to do with security checks there? some syscalls are privileged)
- load kernel startup modules and jump to ring3 bootstrap sequence.
