* Make meddler type emission fully qualify names of parent interface types in ancestor types.
* Make exceptions work.
* Add bootimage namespace introspection and iteration (bootimage_namespace_t?)
* Finish typesystem loading.
* Make a real module loader with all tables and proper memory allocation - current one seems to step over already allocated data...
* Finish introspection and write a command line tool to interactively explore type system.
* Make a memory map tool to see what is allocated where, associate stretches and domains with allocated frames.
* OS block cache - write tests.
