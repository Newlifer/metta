* Add bootimage namespace introspection and iteration (bootimage_namespace_t?)
* Finish typesystem loading.
* Make a real module loader with all tables and proper memory allocation - current one seems to step over already allocated data and needs to preload things in order to work...
* Finish introspection and write a command line tool to interactively explore type system.
* Make a memory map tool to see what is allocated where, associate stretches and domains with allocated frames.
* OS block cache - write tests.
* waf - upgrade to 1.6.10
* waf - make if2code depend on meddler changes


* We need a simple application to start coding from the user perspective.
  Something simple, single focused and immensely mettaish. Ideas?
