* Add bootimage namespace iteration (bootimage_t::namespace_t::iterator?)

* Finish typesystem loading.
  - enter all available interfaces and types
  - meta-interface describes built-in types as well as keeps reference to all other added types

* Implement IDC mechanism.

* Finish introspection and write a command line tool to interactively explore type system.

* Make a real module loader with all tables and proper memory allocation - current one seems to step over already allocated data and needs to preload things in order to work...
* Make a memory map tool to see what is allocated where, associate stretches and domains with allocated frames.

* Assocfs:
  - OS block cache - write tests.
  - write b+tree handler

* write more unit-tests for all these modules!

* waf - upgrade to 1.6.10
* waf - make if2code depend on meddler changes

* We need a simple application to start coding from the user perspective.
  Something simple, single focused and immensely mettaish. Ideas?
