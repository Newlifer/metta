Kernel interface:

Interface page available via kernel_interface_syscall.

Unbuffered IPC - reduces memory copying.
IPC types: Send, Receive, Wait, Call, Reply_and_Wait (+ idempotent versions?)

Try and have separate ABI and APIs for the kernel, much better for portability and writing new software.
