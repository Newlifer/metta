This nucleus has two ways of providing the syscall interface: one is by including arch-specific
syscalls.h file and using *_syscall ABI family of functions. These are architecture specific and try to
perform in the fastest way possible.
Another way is to grab kernel interface page location using kernel_interface_syscall and then by calling code
specified in special table in the interface page. This code tries to minimize amount of context switches and does
as much as possible in userspace, calling specialized syscalls when needed.
