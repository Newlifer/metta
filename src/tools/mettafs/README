Use Qt4 to prototype quickly a file-based tagfs implementation.


A graph-db may be an interesting approach (file contents are nodes, tags are either edges or separate nodes, in which case a semantic relation of object with tag may be specified e.g. FIDO is_a DOG).
Full semantic information at fs level - interesting.
