On-disk layout:
 Bootloader (Multiboot)
 [kernel image]
 [initramdisk image]

Kernel image consists of:
 * trampoline code
 * glue code
 * nucleus code

Trampoline code is usually use-once and can be thrown away after kernel is up
and running. Trampoline code is what is being loaded by the bootloader as a
"kernel."

The glue and nucleus code are then loaded as modules specified in bootloader
or trampoline configuration.

Trampoline code then jumps to the nucleus and can later be disposed of.


Bootloader:
 - call c++ ctors
 - call kernel
 - [on return from kernel] call c++ dtors
 - halt

kernel:
 - init memory layout
 - init cpu(s) (protection, address translation, exception handlers)
   - prepare gdt and idt tables
 - find out init image location
 - unpack initramdisk to designated location
 - parse image header, find components
 - call components constructors
 - call main component entry point

component constructors:
 - run in kernel mode, have the ability to set up their system tables etcetc
 - usual components in init image include:
   - interrupt dispatcher
   - root memory manager
   - portal manager

main component entry point:
 - kserver is the first nester, that provides base Common Protocols components and boots up
   other (sub-)components such as:
   - scheduler
   - security server
   - object (security) manager
